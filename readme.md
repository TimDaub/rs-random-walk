## Context

With my last project, [neume-network](https://github.com/neume-network) I built
a large project purely in node.js and enjoyed myself using it as a system
engineering language. But I also noticed its short-comings and in general, I
felt I wanted to be closer to the metal. So as an attempt of getting there,
rs-random-walk is a first attempt at nearing.
